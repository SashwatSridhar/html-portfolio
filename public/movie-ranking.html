<h1>Sash's Favourite Movies of all time</h1>
    <h2>Sash's top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>1. Madam Web</h3>
<p>Madame Web's earnest approach to the title character's origin story has a certain appeal, 
    but its predictable plot and uneven execution make for a forgettable superhero adventure.</p>

<h3>2. Bob Marley</h3>

<p>Kingsley Ben-Adir does an admirable job in the central role, 
    but Bob Marley: One Love is ultimately a standard biopic that doesn't do justice to its brilliant subject.</p>

<h3>3. Argylle</h3>
<p>Argylle gets some mileage out of its silly, energetic spin on the spy thriller, 
    but ultimately wears out its welcome with a convoluted plot and overlong runtime.</p>
